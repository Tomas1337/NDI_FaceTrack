Default: False Warning: You must pass the name parameter when launching. | Warning: By using this option, you are unable to use any of the following features: | Moveable Home Position : Position where you want the tracker to place 'center' the target person. Speed Sensitivity : Control how fast the camera reacts to movement. Horizontal Threshold : The threshold on how far the target body is from the center. If the distance is above the threshold, horizontal camera tracking will start. Vertical Threshold : The threshold on how far the target body is from the center. If the distance is above the threshold, vertical camera tracking will start. Change sources : Use the menu bar to select available NDI Sources Vertical Tracking toggle and AutoFind toggle are also not useable during hidden UI mode. -l --logging Logging: Use this option for debugging purposes. By enabling this option, you will generate a debug.log on the root directory which will contain debug information. This file may get excessively large so please delete after a debugging session.
